IRC bot written from scratch in Ruby

TODO:
- Implement a database (see below)
- Fix methods to provide for easier coding
- Re-write the controller method
- Consider adding a rails backend for control

I was looking into adding a postgres database, but ActiveRecord is awesome. Its
and abstraction layer so we won't be running database commands, but the ease of
use is there. http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html I know 
the link is to rails, but it can be run without rails http://blog.aizatto.com/2007/05/21/activerecord-without-rails/
